# Node Express MongoDB Mock Server

Welcome to the Node.js Express MongoDB Mock Server! This project provides a mock server setup using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It's designed to help you create a simulated API with sample CRUD operations.

## Features
- **Node.js and Express:** A lightweight and efficient server setup for handling HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving mock data.
- **Sample CRUD Operations:** Includes endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
- **Easy to Customize:** Adapt the mock server to suit your specific needs by modifying routes and data models.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the server: `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`

## Project Structure
- `/models`: MongoDB data models for defining the structure of mock data.
- `/routes`: Express route handlers for different API endpoints.
- `server.js`: Main server file containing the server configuration.

## Usage
Feel free to customize and extend this mock server based on your project requirements. Use it for development, testing, or as a starting point for building more complex APIs.

## Sample Routes
- **GET /api/items:** Get all items.
- **GET /api/items/:id:** Get a specific item by ID.
